## Objects and class

#### Object
Objects are instances of some class, which have some existence. In programming world, existence of objects means they reserve some memory on the RAM, or we can say, JVM heap.

#### Class
A class is a blueprint of an object. A blueprint means that a definition, by which we can categorize some object to a specific type. A class does not reserve any memory on the RAM or JVM heap. It only gives us the definition, which an instance of that class follow to become an object properly.

#### Difference between instance and objects
An instance is a specific object of a class, but with object we mean any instance of a class. The word "object" is used to identify more generously, on the other hand, the word "instance" is used to identify more specifically.
